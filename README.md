# Student Login Page

This is a login page project developed using Java, JDK, Java AWT concept, and Java libraries. It provides a user-friendly interface for students to log in and access their accounts.

## Instructions

To use the Student Login Page, please follow the detailed instructions below:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK) Installation**: Ensure that JDK is installed on your system. You can download the latest version of JDK from the official Oracle website and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Java AWT Concept**: Familiarize yourself with the Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) concept, as it is utilized in this project for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

3. **Download the Project**: Download the project files from the repository to your local machine.

4. **Open the Project**: Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.

5. **Configure Project Libraries**: Ensure that the necessary Java libraries are properly configured in your IDE. This may include libraries for Java AWT and other dependencies used in the project.

6. **Build and Compile**: Build the project in your IDE to compile the Java source code and resolve any dependencies.

7. **Run the Application**: Run the application by executing the main Java file or using the IDE's run command. This will launch the login page interface.

8. **Interact with the Login Page**: Use the login page interface to enter the student's credentials, such as a username and password, in the designated fields. Click the "Login" button to submit the information.

9. **Account Access**: If the provided credentials match a valid student account, the login page will grant access to the student's dashboard or another designated page. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed indicating incorrect login credentials.

10. **Logout**: Make sure to log out from the application when you are finished using it. This can usually be done by clicking a "Logout" button or following the designated logout process.
